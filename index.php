					The Flag is a symbol of leadership, symbol of honour, dignity and sovereignty of a country. Every country has its own national flag that is distinctive to create a sense of pride to the country. The Flag is defined as a piece of cloth exhibited to show the sign that is also known as the flag and torch. The flag in the Malay culture is normally associated with the status of the Royal Rulers.
					There are 14 red and white equal strips with the red band on top and ends with the white band at the bottom. These strips mark the membership of the 13 states and a Federal Territory namely Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Johor, Perak, Perlis, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Terengganu, Sarawak, Penang, Sabah, Malacca and Federal Territory (Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya). The red strips indicate 
					heroic bravery and the white strips on the other hand, mean purity. The yellow of the crescent and star is the Royal colour of the Malay Rulers. The combination of the three primary colours which are red, white and blue represent the unity of Federal Malay states (Persekutuan Tanah Melayu) and the United Kingdom and the unity of Malaya (Tanah Melayu) with the Commonwealth countries.
					In this websites, we include a full details of the flag of 13 states and 3 federal territories in Malaysia.
